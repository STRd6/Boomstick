Boomstick [Alpha] enables HTML5 and JavaScript games to access native JoySticks.

By using FireBreath to handle cross-browser, multi-platform plugin generation
and OIS to handle multi-platform joystick input, Boomstick gives JavaScript
applications total access to joysticks and gamepads.

Currently only tested on Linux with FF and Chrome, but with minor changes should
work everywhere.
